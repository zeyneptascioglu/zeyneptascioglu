# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jasmine Z. Tascioglu

I study Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Southampton. I'm currently working on an EMG-controlled robotic arm as part of a summer internship, blending flexible electronics, signal processing, and embedded systems. In the past, Iâ€™ve researched quantum sensing in Prof. Hendrik Ulbrichtâ€™s group. Iâ€™m passionate about building hardware that interacts intelligently with the world.

## ðŸ’¡ About Me

Iâ€™m an aspiring hardware engineer with hands-on experience in both academic research and real-world projects. I enjoy solving complex problems, building intelligent systems, and contributing to innovative technologies that have social impact.
